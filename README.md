# OpenSearch

Hello!

OpenSearch is an open source search and analytics engine derived from Elasticsearch 7.10.2, and is currently in an alpha state. While we're still in the process of getting set up, we are excited to build the best distributed search engine on the planet with you.

We officially began work on the new fork on January 21st, 2021.  Since then, we've been removing non-Apache 2.0 compliant code and doing a full rename of the project.  Feel free to take a look around at what we've been up to, and then head over to look at the [open issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues).  Or you could jump right in and [start opening issues](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues/new/choose) or [contributing](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Guiding Principles

Here are the principles we use to guide our development.  From [opensearch.org](http://opensearch.org):


> When we (the contributors) are successful, the OpenSearch project will be:
>
>**1. Great software**. If it doesn’t solve your problems, everything else is moot. It’s going to be software you love to use.
>
>**2. Open source like we mean it**. We are invested in this being a successful open source project for the long term. It’s all Apache 2.0. There’s no Contributor License Agreement. Easy.
>
>**3. A level playing field**. We will not tweak the software so that it runs better for any vendor (including AWS) at the expense of others. If this happens, call it out and we will fix it as a community.
>
>**4. Used everywhere**. Our goal is for as many people as possible to use it in their business, their software, and their projects. Use it however you want. Surprise us!
>
>**5. Made with your input**. We will ask for public input on direction, requirements, and implementation for any feature we build.
>
>**6. Open to contributions**. Great open source software is built together, with a diverse community of contributors. If you want to get involved at any level - big, small, or huge - we will find a way to make that happen. We don’t know what that looks like yet, and we look forward to figuring it out together.
>
>**7. Respectful, approachable, and friendly**. This will be a community where you will be heard, accepted, and valued, whether you are a new or experienced user or contributor.
>
>**8. A place to invent**. You will be able to innovate rapidly. This project will have a stable and predictable foundation that is modular, making it easy to extend.

## How you can help

### Look for the tag "help wanted"

If you're excited to jump in, we've marked a few issues that would be [really helpful](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22).

### Watch the forum, because there are a bunch of things we want to talk about
As we've been working, we've come up with a bunch of questions that we wanted to get community feedback on.  Now that we're done with this first pass of renaming, you'll see us posting those questions to the [forums](https://discuss.opendistrocommunity.dev/).  Please let us know your thoughts!
