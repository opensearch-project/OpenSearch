## Welcome!

**OpenSearch** is [a community-driven, open source fork](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/) of [Elasticsearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch) and [Kibana](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibana) following the [licence change](https://opensource.org/node/1099) in early 2021. We're looking to sustain (and evolve!) a search and analytics suite for the multitude of businesses who are dependent on the rights granted by the original, [Apache v2.0 License](LICENSE.txt).
