 * This class is loaded by JVM SPI mechanism in order to provide ISO compatible behaviour for week calculations using java.time.
 * It defines start of the week as Monday and requires 4 days in the first week of the year.
 * This class overrides default behaviour for Locale.ROOT (start of the week Sunday, minimum 1 day in the first week of the year).
 * Java SPI mechanism requires java.locale.providers to contain SPI value (i.e. java.locale.providers=SPI,COMPAT)
