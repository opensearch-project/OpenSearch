/**
 * This component is responsible for maintaining connections from this node to all the nodes listed in the cluster state, and for
 * disconnecting from nodes once they are removed from the cluster state. It periodically checks that all connections are still open and
 * restores them if needed. Note that this component is *not* responsible for removing nodes from the cluster state if they disconnect or
 * are unresponsive: this is the job of the cluster-manager's fault detection components, particularly {@link FollowersChecker}.
 * <p>
 * The {@link NodeConnectionsService#connectToNodes(DiscoveryNodes, Runnable)} and {@link
 * NodeConnectionsService#disconnectFromNodesExcept(DiscoveryNodes)} methods are called on the {@link ClusterApplier} thread. This component
 * allows the {@code ClusterApplier} to block on forming connections to _new_ nodes, because the rest of the system treats a missing
 * connection with another node in the cluster state as an exceptional condition and we don't want this to happen to new nodes. However we
 * need not block on re-establishing existing connections because if a connection is down then we are already in an exceptional situation
 * and it doesn't matter much if we stay in this situation a little longer.
 * <p>
 * This component does not block on disconnections at all, because a disconnection might need to wait for an ongoing (background) connection
 * attempt to complete first.
