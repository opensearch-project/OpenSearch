    /**
     * Performs {@link BucketCollector#postCollection()} on all the {@link BucketCollector} in the given {@link Collector} collector tree
     * after the collection of documents on a leaf is completed. This method will be called by different slice threads on its own collector
     * tree instance in case of concurrent segment search such that postCollection happens on the same slice thread which initialize and
     * perform collection of the documents for a leaf segment. For sequential search case, there is always a single search thread which
     * performs both collection and postCollection on {@link BucketCollector}.
     * <p>
     * This was originally done in {@link org.opensearch.search.aggregations.AggregationProcessor#postProcess(SearchContext)}. But with
     * concurrent segment search path this needs to be performed here. There are AssertingCodecs in lucene which validates that the
     * DocValues created for a field is always used by the same thread for a request. In concurrent segment search case, the DocValues
     * gets initialized on different threads for different segments (or slices). Whereas the postProcess happens as part of reduce phase
     * and is performed on the separate thread which is from search threadpool and not from slice threadpool. So two different threads
     * performs the access on the DocValues causing the AssertingCodec to fail. From functionality perspective, there is no issue as
     * DocValues for each segment is always accessed by a single thread at a time but those threads may be different (e.g. slice thread
     * during collection and then search thread during reduce)
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * NOTE: We can evaluate and deprecate this postCollection processing once lucene release the changes described in the
     * <a href="https://github.com/apache/lucene/issues/12375">issue-12375</a>. With this new change we should be able to implement
     * {@link BucketCollector#postCollection()} functionality using the lucene interface directly such that postCollection gets called
     * from the slice thread by lucene itself
