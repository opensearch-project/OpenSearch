     * the generation is not {@code null}, this method tries to open the given translog generation. The generation is treated as the last
     * generation referenced from already committed data. This means all operations that have not yet been committed should be in the
     * translog file referenced by this generation. The translog creation will fail if this generation can't be opened.

     * @param config                   the configuration of this translog
     * @param translogUUID             the translog uuid to open, null for a new translog
     * @param deletionPolicy           an instance of {@link TranslogDeletionPolicy} that controls when a translog file can be safely
     *                                 deleted
     * @param globalCheckpointSupplier a supplier for the global checkpoint
     * @param primaryTermSupplier      a supplier for the latest value of primary term of the owning index shard. The latest term value is
     *                                 examined and stored in the header whenever a new generation is rolled. It's guaranteed from outside
     *                                 that a new generation is rolled when the term is increased. This guarantee allows to us to validate
     *                                 and reject operation whose term is higher than the primary term stored in the translog header.
     * @param persistedSequenceNumberConsumer a callback that's called whenever an operation with a given sequence number is successfully
     *                                        persisted.
