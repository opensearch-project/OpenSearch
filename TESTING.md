# Requirements

You will need the following pieces of software to run these tests:

- Docker & Docker Compose
- Vagrant
- JDK 11
- Gradle

# Creating packages

To create a distribution without running the tests, run the following:

    ./gradlew assemble

To create a platform-specific build, use the following depending on your operating system:

    ./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble
    ./gradlew :distribution:archives:darwin-tar:assemble
    ./gradlew :distribution:archives:windows-zip:assemble

## Running OpenSearch from a checkout

In order to run OpenSearch from source without building a package, you can run it using Gradle:

    ./gradlew run

### Launching and debugging from an IDE

**NOTE:** If you have imported the project into IntelliJ according to the instructions in [DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md](DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md#intellij-idea), then a debug run configuration named **Debug OpenSearch** will be created for you and configured appropriately.

To run OpenSearch in debug mode,

1. Start the `Debug OpenSearch` in IntelliJ by pressing the debug icon.
2. From a terminal run the following `./gradlew run --debug-jvm`. You can also run this task in IntelliJ.

This will instruct all JVMs (including any that run cli tools such as creating the keyring or adding users) to suspend and initiate a debug connection on port incrementing from `5005`. As such, the IDE needs to be instructed to listen for connections on this port. Since we might run multiple JVMs as part of configuring and starting the cluster, it's recommended to configure the IDE to initiate multiple listening attempts. In case of IntelliJ, this option is called "Auto restart" and needs to be checked. In case of Eclipse, "Connection limit" setting needs to be configured with a greater value (ie 10 or more).

### Other useful arguments

-   In order to start a node with a different max heap space add: `-Dtests.heap.size=4G`
-   In order to disable assertions add: `-Dtests.asserts=false`
-   In order to use a custom data directory: `--data-dir=/tmp/foo`
-   In order to preserve data in between executions: `--preserve-data`
-   In order to remotely attach a debugger to the process: `--debug-jvm`
-   In order to set a different keystore password: `--keystore-password yourpassword`
-   In order to set an OpenSearch setting, provide a setting with the following prefix: `-Dtests.opensearch.`
-   In order to enable stack trace of the MockSpanData during testing, add: `-Dtests.telemetry.span.stack_traces=true` (Storing stack traces alongside span data can be useful for comprehensive debugging and performance optimization during testing, as it provides insights into the exact code paths and execution sequences, facilitating efficient issue identification and resolution. Note: Enabling this might lead to OOM issues while running ITs)

## Test case filtering

To be able to run a single test you need to specify the module where you're running the tests from.

Example: `./gradlew server:test --tests "*.ReplicaShardBatchAllocatorTests.testNoAsyncFetchData"`

Run a single test case (variants)

    ./gradlew module:test --tests org.opensearch.package.ClassName
    ./gradlew module:test --tests org.opensearch.package.ClassName.testName
    ./gradlew module:test --tests "*.ClassName"

Run all tests in a package and its sub-packages

    ./gradlew module:test --tests "org.opensearch.package.*"

Run any test methods that contain *esi* (e.g.: .r*esi*ze.)

    ./gradlew module:test --tests "*esi*"

Run all tests that are waiting for a bugfix (disabled by default)

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.filter=@awaitsfix

## Seed and repetitions

Run with a given seed (seed is a hex-encoded long).

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.seed=DEADBEEF

## Repeats *all* tests of ClassName N times

Every test repetition will have a different method seed (derived from a single random master seed).

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.iters=N -Dtests.class=*.ClassName

## Repeats *all* tests of ClassName N times

Every test repetition will have exactly the same master (0xdead) and method-level (0xbeef) seed.

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.iters=N -Dtests.class=*.ClassName -Dtests.seed=DEAD:BEEF

## Repeats a given test N times

Note that individual test repetitions are passed suffixes, such as: `testFoo[0]`, `testFoo[1]`, etc. Thus using `testmethod` or `tests.method` ending in a glob is necessary to ensure iterations are run.

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.iters=N -Dtests.class=*.ClassName -Dtests.method=mytest*

Repeats N times but skips any tests after the first failure or M initial failures.

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.iters=N -Dtests.failfast=true -Dtestcase=...
    ./gradlew test -Dtests.iters=N -Dtests.maxfailures=M -Dtestcase=...

## Test groups

Test groups can be enabled or disabled (true/false).

Default value provided below in \[brackets\].

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.awaitsfix=[false] - known issue (@AwaitsFix)

## Load balancing and caches

By default, the tests run on multiple processes using all the available cores on all available CPUs. Not including hyper-threading. If you want to explicitly specify the number of JVMs you can do so on the command line:

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.jvms=8

Or in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties`:

    systemProp.tests.jvms=8

It's difficult to pick the "right" number here. Hypercores donâ€™t count for CPU intensive tests, and you should leave some slack for JVM-internal threads like the garbage collector. And you have to have enough RAM to handle each JVM.

## Test compatibility

It is possible to provide a version that allows to adapt the tests' behaviour to older features or bugs that have been changed or fixed in the meantime.

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.compatibility=1.0.0

## Retries

The goal of tests is to be completely deterministic such that any test failure can be easily and reliably reproduced. However, the reality is that many OpenSearch integration tests have non-deterministic behavior which results in rare test failures that cannot be easily reproduced even using the same random test seed. To mitigate the pain of frequent non-reproducible test failures, limited retries have been introduced using the Gradle [test-retry](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/org.gradle.test-retry) plugin. The known flaky tests are explicitly listed in the test-retry configuration of the build.gradle file. This is intended as a temporary mitigation for existing flakiness, and as such new tests should not be added to the retry list. Any new addition to the retry list must provide a thorough rationale as to why adding retries is the right thing to do as opposed to fixing the underlying flakiness. Existing flaky tests are tracked in GitHub with the [Flaky Random Test Failure](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22flaky-test%22) label.

## Miscellaneous

Run all tests without stopping on errors (inspect log files).

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.haltonfailure=false

Run more verbose output (JVM parameters, etc.).

    ./gradlew test -verbose

Change the default suite timeout to 5 seconds for all tests (note the exclamation mark).

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.timeoutSuite=5000! ...

Change the logging level of OpenSearch (not Gradle)

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.opensearch.logger.level=DEBUG

Print all the logging output from the test runs to the command line even if tests are passing.

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.output=true

Configure the heap size.

    ./gradlew test -Dtests.heap.size=512m

Pass arbitrary jvm arguments.

    # specify heap dump path
    ./gradlew test -Dtests.jvm.argline="-XX:HeapDumpPath=/path/to/heapdumps"
    # enable gc logging
    ./gradlew test -Dtests.jvm.argline="-verbose:gc"
    # enable security debugging
    ./gradlew test -Dtests.jvm.argline="-Djava.security.debug=access,failure"

# Running verification tasks

To run all verification tasks, including static checks, unit tests, and integration tests:

    ./gradlew check

Note that this will also run the unit tests and precommit tasks first. If you want to just run the in memory cluster integration tests (because you are debugging them):

    ./gradlew internalClusterTest

To run a specific set of tests.

    ./gradlew :server:internalClusterTest --tests "org.opensearch.common.settings.FallbackSettingsIT.*"

If you want to just run the precommit checks:

    ./gradlew precommit

Some of these checks will require `docker-compose` installed for bringing up test fixtures. If itâ€™s not present those checks will be skipped automatically.

# Testing the REST layer

The REST layer is tested through specific tests that are executed against a cluster that is configured and initialized via Gradle. The tests themselves can be written in either Java or with a YAML based DSL.

YAML based REST tests should be preferred since these are shared between clients. The YAML based tests describe the operations to be executed, and the obtained results that need to be tested.

The YAML tests support various operators defined in the [rest-api-spec](/rest-api-spec/src/main/resources/rest-api-spec/test/README.md) and adhere to the [OpenSearch REST API JSON specification](/rest-api-spec/README.md). In order to run the YAML tests, the relevant API specification needs to be on the test classpath. Any gradle project that has support for REST tests will get the primary API on itâ€™s class path. However, to better support Gradle incremental builds, it is recommended to explicitly declare which parts of the API the tests depend upon.

For example:

    restResources {
      restApi {
        includeCore '_common', 'indices', 'index', 'cluster', 'nodes', 'get', 'ingest'
      }
    }

The REST tests are run automatically when executing the "./gradlew check" command. To run only the YAML REST tests use the following command (modules and plugins may also include YAML REST tests):

    ./gradlew :rest-api-spec:yamlRestTest

A specific test case can be run with the following command:

    ./gradlew ':rest-api-spec:yamlRestTest' \
      --tests "org.opensearch.test.rest.ClientYamlTestSuiteIT" \
      -Dtests.method="test {p0=cat.segments/10_basic/Help}"

The YAML REST tests support all the options provided by the randomized runner, plus the following:

-   `tests.rest.suite`: comma separated paths of the test suites to be run (by default loaded from /rest-api-spec/test). It is possible to run only a subset of the tests providing a sub-folder or even a single yaml file (the default /rest-api-spec/test prefix is optional when files are loaded from classpath) e.g. `-Dtests.rest.suite=index,get,create/10_with_id`

-   `tests.rest.denylist`: comma separated globs that identify tests that are denylisted and need to be skipped e.g. `-Dtests.rest.denylist=index/**/Index document,get/10_basic/**`

Java REST tests can be run with the "javaRestTest" task.

For example :

    ./gradlew :modules:mapper-extras:javaRestTest

    ./gradlew ':modules:mapper-extras:javaRestTest' \
      --tests "org.opensearch.index.mapper.TokenCountFieldMapperIntegrationIT.testSearchByTokenCount {storeCountedFields=true loadCountedFields=false}"

yamlRestTestâ€™s and javaRestTestâ€™s are easy to identify, since they are found in a respective source directory. However, there are some more specialized REST tests that use custom task names. These are usually found in "qa" projects commonly use the "integTest" task.

If in doubt about which command to use, simply run &lt;gradle path&gt;:check

## Running REST Tests Against An External Cluster

Note that the REST tests, like all the integration tests, can be run against an external cluster by specifying the following properties `tests.cluster`, `tests.rest.cluster`, `tests.clustername`. Use a comma separated list of node properties for the multi-node cluster.

For example :

    ./gradlew :rest-api-spec:yamlRestTest \
      -Dtests.cluster=localhost:9200 -Dtests.rest.cluster=localhost:9200 -Dtests.clustername=opensearch

## Debugging REST Tests

You can launch a local OpenSearch cluster in debug mode following [Launching and debugging from an IDE](#launching-and-debugging-from-an-ide), and run your REST tests against that following [Running REST Tests Against An External Cluster](#running-rest-tests-against-an-external-cluster).

# Testing packaging

The packaging tests use Vagrant virtual machines or cloud instances to verify that installing and running OpenSearch distributions works correctly on supported operating systems. These tests should really only be run on ephemeral systems because theyâ€™re destructive; that is, these tests install and remove packages and freely modify system settings, so you will probably regret it if you execute them on your development machine.

When you run a packaging test, Gradle will set up the target VM and mount your repository directory in the VM. Once this is done, a Gradle task will issue a Vagrant command to run a **nested** Gradle task on the VM. This nested Gradle runs the actual "destructive" test classes.

1.  Install Virtual Box and Vagrant.

2.  (Optional) Install [vagrant-cachier](https://github.com/fgrehm/vagrant-cachier) to squeeze a bit more performance out of the process (Note: as of 2021, vagrant-cachier is unmaintained):

        vagrant plugin install vagrant-cachier

3.  You can run all the OS packaging tests with `./gradlew packagingTest`. This task includes our legacy `bats` tests.

    To run only the OS tests that are written in Java, run `.gradlew distroTest`, will cause Gradle to build the tar, zip, and deb packages and all the plugins. It will then run the tests on every available system. This will take a very long time.

    Fortunately, the various systems under test have their own Gradle tasks under `qa/os`. To find out what packaging combinations can be tested on a system, run the `tasks` task. For example:

        ./gradlew :qa:os:ubuntu-1804:tasks

    If you want a quick test of the tarball and RPM packaging for Centos 7, you would run:

        ./gradlew :qa:os:centos-7:distroTest.rpm :qa:os:centos-7:distroTest.linux-archive

Note that if you interrupt Gradle in the middle of running these tasks, any boxes started will remain running, and youâ€™ll have to stop them manually with `./gradlew --stop` or `vagrant halt`.

All the regular vagrant commands should just work, so you can get a shell in a VM running trusty by running `vagrant up ubuntu-1604 --provider virtualbox && vagrant ssh ubuntu-1604`.

These are the linux flavors supported, all of which we provide images for

-   ubuntu-1604 aka xenial
-   ubuntu-1804 aka bionic beaver
-   debian-8 aka jessie
-   debian-9 aka stretch, the current debian stable distribution
-   centos-6
-   centos-7
-   rhel-8
-   fedora-28
-   fedora-29
-   oel-6 aka Oracle Enterprise Linux 6
-   oel-7 aka Oracle Enterprise Linux 7
-   sles-12
-   opensuse-42 aka Leap

Weâ€™re missing the following from the support matrix because there are no high quality boxes available in vagrant atlas:

-   sles-11

## Testing packaging on Windows

The packaging tests also support Windows Server 2012R2 and Windows Server 2016. Unfortunately weâ€™re not able to provide boxes for them in open source use because of licensing issues. Any Virtualbox image that has WinRM and Powershell enabled for remote users should work.

Testing on Windows requires the [vagrant-winrm](https://github.com/criteo/vagrant-winrm) plugin.

    vagrant plugin install vagrant-winrm

Specify the image IDs of the Windows boxes to gradle with the following project properties. They can be set in `~/.gradle/gradle.properties` such as

    vagrant.windows-2012r2.id=my-image-id
    vagrant.windows-2016.id=another-image-id

or passed on the command line such as `-Pvagrant.windows-2012r2.id=my-image-id` or `-Pvagrant.windows-2016=another-image-id`

These properties are required for Windows support in all gradle tasks that handle packaging tests. Either or both may be specified.

If youâ€™re running vagrant commands outside of gradle, specify the Windows boxes with the environment variables.

-   `VAGRANT_WINDOWS_2012R2_BOX`
-   `VAGRANT_WINDOWS_2016_BOX`

## Testing VMs are disposable

Itâ€™s important to think of VMs like cattle. If they become lame you just shoot them and let vagrant reprovision them. Say youâ€™ve hosed your precise VM:

    vagrant ssh ubuntu-1604 -c 'sudo rm -rf /bin'; echo oops

All youâ€™ve got to do to get another one is

    vagrant destroy -f ubuntu-1604 && vagrant up ubuntu-1604 --provider virtualbox

The whole process takes a minute and a half on a modern laptop, two and a half without vagrant-cachier.

Some vagrant commands will work on all VMs at once:

    vagrant halt
    vagrant destroy -f

`vagrant up` would normally start all the VMs, but weâ€™ve prevented that because thatâ€™d consume a ton of ram.

## Iterating on packaging tests

Because our packaging tests are capable of testing many combinations of OS (e.g., Windows, Linux, etc.), package type (e.g., zip file, RPM, etc.) and so forth, itâ€™s faster to develop against smaller subsets of the tests. For example, to run tests for the default archive distribution on Fedora 28:

    ./gradlew :qa:os:fedora-28:distroTest.linux-archive

These test tasks can use the `--tests`, `--info`, and `--debug` parameters just like non-OS tests can. For example:

    ./gradlew :qa:os:fedora-28:distroTest.linux-archive --tests "com.opensearch.packaging.test.ArchiveTests"

# Testing backwards compatibility

Backwards compatibility tests exist to test upgrading from each supported version to the current version.

The test can be run for any versions which the current version will be compatible with. Tests are run for released versions download the distributions from the artifact repository, see [DistributionDownloadPlugin](./buildSrc/src/main/java/org/opensearch/gradle/DistributionDownloadPlugin.java) for the repository location. Tests are run for versions that are not yet released automatically check out the branch and build from source to get the distributions, see [BwcVersions](./buildSrc/src/main/java/org/opensearch/gradle/BwcVersions.java) and [distribution/bwc/build.gradle](./distribution/bwc/build.gradle) for more information.

The minimum JDK versions for runtime and compiling need to be installed, and environment variables `JAVAx_HOME`, such as `JAVA8_HOME`, pointing to the JDK installations are required to run the tests against unreleased versions, since the distributions are created by building from source. The required JDK versions for each branch are located at [.ci/java-versions.properties](.ci/java-versions.properties), see [BwcSetupExtension](./buildSrc/src/main/java/org/opensearch/gradle/internal/BwcSetupExtension.java) for more information.

To run all the backwards compatibility tests use:

    ./gradlew bwcTest

A specific version can be tested as well. For example, to test bwc with version 5.3.2 run:

    ./gradlew v5.3.2#bwcTest

Use -Dtest.class and -Dtests.method to run a specific bwcTest test. For example to test a rolling upgrade from 7.7.0:

    ./gradlew :qa:rolling-upgrade:v7.7.0#bwcTest \
     -Dtests.class=org.opensearch.upgrades.RecoveryIT \
     -Dtests.method=testHistoryUUIDIsGenerated

Use `-PcustomDistributionDownloadType=bundle` to run the bwcTest against the test cluster with latest CI distribution bundle set up for the specified version; this property is default to min and exclusive choices between `bundle` and `min`:

    ./gradlew bwcTest -PcustomDistributionDownloadType=bundle

When running `./gradlew check`, minimal bwc checks are also run against compatible versions that are not yet released.

## BWC Testing against a specific remote/branch

Sometimes a backward compatibility change spans two versions. A common case is a new functionality that needs a BWC bridge in an unreleased versioned of a release branch (for example, 5.x). To test the changes, you can instruct Gradle to build the BWC version from a another remote/branch combination instead of pulling the release branch from GitHub. You do so using the `bwc.remote` and `bwc.refspec.BRANCH` system properties:

    ./gradlew check -Dbwc.remote=${remote} -Dbwc.refspec.5.x=index_req_bwc_5.x

The branch needs to be available on the remote that the BWC makes of the repository you run the tests from. Using the remote is a handy trick to make sure that a branch is available and is up to date in the case of multiple runs.

Example:

Say you need to make a change to `main` and have a BWC layer in `5.x`. You will need to: . Create a branch called `index_req_change` off your remote `${remote}`. This will contain your change. . Create a branch called `index_req_bwc_5.x` off `5.x`. This will contain your bwc layer. . Push both branches to your remote repository. . Run the tests with `./gradlew check -Dbwc.remote=${remote} -Dbwc.refspec.5.x=index_req_bwc_5.x`.

## BWC Testing with security

You may want to run BWC tests for a secure OpenSearch cluster. In order to do this, you will need to follow a few additional steps:

1. Clone the OpenSearch Security repository from https://github.com/opensearch-project/security.
2. Get both the old version of the Security plugin (the version you wish to come from) and the new version of the Security plugin (the version you wish to go to). This can be done either by fetching the maven artifact with a command like `wget https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/opensearch/plugin/opensearch-security/<TARGET_VERSION>.0/opensearch-security-<TARGET_VERSION>.0.zip` or by running `./gradlew assemble` from the base of the Security repository.
3. Move both of the Security artifacts into new directories at the path `/security/bwc-test/src/test/resources/<TARGET_VERSION>.0`. You should end up with two different directories in `/security/bwc-test/src/test/resources/`, one named the old version and one the new version.
4. Run the following command from the base of the Security repository:

```
  ./gradlew -p bwc-test clean bwcTestSuite \
  -Dtests.security.manager=false \
  -Dtests.opensearch.http.protocol=https \
  -Dtests.opensearch.username=admin \
  -Dtests.opensearch.password=admin \
  -PcustomDistributionUrl="/OpenSearch/distribution/archives/linux-tar/build/distributions/opensearch-min-<TARGET_VERSION>-SNAPSHOT-linux-x64.tar.gz" \
  -i
```

`-Dtests.security.manager=false` handles access issues when attempting to read the certificates from the file system.
`-Dtests.opensearch.http.protocol=https` tells the wait for cluster startup task to do the right thing.
`-PcustomDistributionUrl=...` uses a custom build of the distribution of OpenSearch. This is unnecessary when running against standard/unmodified OpenSearch core distributions.

### Skip fetching latest

For some BWC testing scenarios, you want to use the local clone of the repository without fetching latest. For these use cases, you can set the system property `tests.bwc.git_fetch_latest` to `false` and the BWC builds will skip fetching the latest from the remote.

# How to write good tests?

## Base classes for test cases

There are multiple base classes for tests:

-   **`OpenSearchTestCase`**: The base class of all tests. It is typically extended directly by unit tests.
-   **`OpenSearchSingleNodeTestCase`**: This test case sets up a cluster that has a single node.
-   **`OpenSearchIntegTestCase`**: An integration test case that creates a cluster that might have multiple nodes.
-   **`OpenSearchRestTestCase`**: An integration tests that interacts with an external cluster via the REST API. This is used for Java based REST tests.
-   **`OpenSearchClientYamlSuiteTestCase`** : A subclass of `OpenSearchRestTestCase` used to run YAML based REST tests.

## Good practices

### What kind of tests should I write?

Unit tests are the preferred way to test some functionality: most of the time they are simpler to understand, more likely to reproduce, and unlikely to be affected by changes that are unrelated to the piece of functionality that is being tested.

The reason why `OpenSearchSingleNodeTestCase` exists is that all our components used to be very hard to set up in isolation, which had led us to having a number of integration tests but close to no unit tests. `OpenSearchSingleNodeTestCase` is a workaround for this issue which provides an easy way to spin up a node and get access to components that are hard to instantiate like `IndicesService`. Whenever practical, you should prefer unit tests.

Finally, if the functionality under test needs to be run in a cluster, there are two test classes to consider:
  * `OpenSearchRestTestCase` will connect to an external cluster. This is a good option if the tests cases don't rely on a specific configuration of the test cluster. A test cluster is set up as part of the Gradle task running integration tests, and test cases using this class can connect to it. The configuration of the cluster is provided in the Gradle files.
  * `OpenSearchIntegTestCase` will create a local cluster as part of each test case. The configuration of the cluster is controlled by the test class. This is a good option if different tests cases depend on different cluster configurations, as it would be impractical (and limit parallelization) to keep re-configuring (and re-starting) the external cluster for each test case. A good example of when this class might come in handy is for testing security features, where different cluster configurations are needed to fully test each one.

In short, most new functionality should come with unit tests, and optionally integration tests using either an external cluster or a local one if there's a need for more specific cluster configurations, as those are more costly and harder to maintain/debug.

### Refactor code to make it easier to test

Unfortunately, a large part of our code base is still hard to unit test. Sometimes because some classes have lots of dependencies that make them hard to instantiate. Sometimes because API contracts make tests hard to write. Code refactors that make functionality easier to unit test are encouraged.

## Bad practices

### Use randomized-testing for coverage

In general, randomization should be used for parameters that are not expected to affect the behavior of the functionality that is being tested. For instance the number of shards should not impact `date_histogram` aggregations, and the choice of the `store` type (`niofs` vs `mmapfs`) does not affect the results of a query. Such randomization helps improve confidence that we are not relying on implementation details of one component or specifics of some setup.

However, it should not be used for coverage. For instance if you are testing a piece of functionality that enters different code paths depending on whether the index has 1 shards or 2+ shards, then we shouldnâ€™t just test against an index with a random number of shards: there should be one test for the 1-shard case, and another test for the 2+ shards case.

### Abuse randomization in multi-threaded tests

Multi-threaded tests are often not reproducible due to the fact that there is no guarantee on the order in which operations occur across threads. Adding randomization to the mix usually makes things worse and should be done with care.

### Use `Thread.sleep`

`Thread.sleep()` is almost always a bad idea because it is very difficult to know that you've waited long enough. Using primitives like `waitUntil` or `assertBusy`, which use Thread.sleep internally, is okay to wait for a specific condition. However, it is almost always better to instrument your code with concurrency primitives like a `CountDownLatch` that will allow you to deterministically wait for a specific condition, without waiting longer than necessary that will happen with a polling approach used by `assertBusy`.

Example:
- [PrimaryShardAllocatorIT](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/7ffcd6500e0bd5956cef5c289ee66d9f99d533fc/server/src/internalClusterTest/java/org/opensearch/gateway/ReplicaShardAllocatorIT.java#L208-L235): This test is using two latches: one to wait for a recovery to start and one to block that recovery so that it can deterministically test things that happen during a recovery.

### Expect a specific segment topology

By design, OpenSearch integration tests will vary how the merge policy works because in almost all scenarios you should not depend on a specific segment topology (in the real world your code will see a huge diversity of indexing workloads with OpenSearch merging things in the background all the time!). If you do in fact need to care about the segment topology (e.g. for testing statistics that might vary slightly depending on number of segments), then you must take care to ensure that segment topology is deterministic by doing things like disabling background refreshes, force merging after indexing data, etc.

Example:
- [SegmentReplicationResizeRequestIT](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/f715ee1a485e550802accc1c2e3d8101208d4f0b/server/src/internalClusterTest/java/org/opensearch/indices/replication/SegmentReplicationResizeRequestIT.java#L102-L109): This test disables refreshes to prevent interfering with the segment replication behavior under test.

### Leave environment in an unstable state after test

The default test case will ensure that no open file handles or running threads are left after tear down. You must ensure that all resources are cleaned up at the end of each test case, or else the cleanup may end up racing with the tear down logic in the base test class in a way that is very difficult to reproduce.

Example:
- [AwarenessAttributeDecommissionIT](https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch/blob/main/server/src/internalClusterTest/java/org/opensearch/cluster/coordination/AwarenessAttributeDecommissionIT.java#L951): Recommissions any decommissioned nodes at the end of the test to ensure the after-test checks succeed.

# Test coverage analysis

The code coverage report can be generated through Gradle with [JaCoCo plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/jacoco_plugin.html).

For unit test:

    ./gradlew codeCoverageReportForUnitTest

For integration test:

    ./gradlew codeCoverageReportForIntegrationTest

For the combined tests (unit and integration):

    ./gradlew codeCoverageReport

To generate coverage report for the combined tests after `check` task:

    ./gradlew check -Dtests.coverage=true

The code coverage report will be generated in `build/codeCoverageReport`, `build/codeCoverageReportForUnitTest` or `build/codeCoverageReportForIntegrationTest` correspondingly.

The report will be in XML format only by default, but you can add the following parameter for HTML and CSV format.

- To generate report in HTML format: `-Dtests.coverage.report.html=true`
- To generate report in CSV format: `-Dtests.coverage.report.csv=true`
- To NOT generate report in XML format: `-Dtests.coverage.report.xml=false`

For example, to generate code coverage report in HTML format and not in XML format:

    ./gradlew codeCoverageReport -Dtests.coverage.report.html=true -Dtests.coverage.report.xml=false

Apart from using Gradle, it is also possible to gain insight in code coverage using IntelliJâ€™s built-in coverage analysis tool that can measure coverage upon executing specific tests. Eclipse may also be able to do the same using the EclEmma plugin.

Please read your IDE documentation for how to attach a debugger to a JVM process.

# Testing with plugins

To test a plugin with a custom build of OpenSearch, build OpenSearch and use the `customDistributionUrl` setting supported by each plugin to override the OpenSearch distribution.

For example, in your OpenSearch repository assemble a custom distribution.

    ./gradlew :distribution:archives:linux-tar:assemble

Then in your plugin repository, substitute in your OpenSearch build

    ./gradlew run -PcustomDistributionUrl="<OPENSEARCH-REPO-PATH>/distribution/archives/linux-tar/build/distributions/opensearch-min-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-linux-x64.tar.gz"

# Environment misc

There is a known issue with macOS localhost resolve strategy that can cause some integration tests to fail. This is because integration tests have timings for cluster formation, discovery, etc. that can be exceeded if name resolution takes a long time. To fix this, make sure you have your computer name (as returned by `hostname`) inside `/etc/hosts`, e.g.:

    127.0.0.1       localhost OpenSearchMBP.local
    255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
    ::1             localhost OpenSearchMBP.local`
