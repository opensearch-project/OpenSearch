# CODEOWNERS manages notifications, not PR approvals
# For PR approvals see /.github/workflows/maintainer-approval.yml

# Files have a single rule applied, the last match decides the owner
# If you would like to more specifically apply ownership, include existing owner in new sub fields

# To verify changes of CODEOWNERS file
# In VSCode
#   1. Install extension https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jasonnutter.vscode-codeowners
#   2. Go to a file
#   3. Use the command palette to run the CODEOWNERS: Show owners of current file command, which will display all code owners for the current file.

# Default ownership for all repo files
